Im an example you can include many words, it might count them!!! sometimes it can be inaccurate by 1 or 10 words. Its best to make sure everything is properly punctuated to remove this problem!. Dont forget to compare to other word counts like google docs ect for a secondary reference number if its critical its within a limit.
